1.differential_goes_sbox_11_bit_v1.cpp is the program to reconstruct a 11-bit S-box by solving the sign determination problems. We compile it as random-11 with optimization flag -O2 using "g++". You can run it with the command "./random-11 a b", where a is the number of good columns you are searching for and b is the index of random S-box(sbox-11-b.txt).
2.gad_11.cpp is the program to reconstruct a 11-bit S-box with the original guess and determine algorithm. We compile it as g_d_11 with optimization flag -O2 using "g++". You can run it with the command "./g_d_11 a", where a is the index of random S-box(sbox-11-a.txt).
3.output-11.txt records the timing data of running all the s-boxes with our approach. gad-11.txt records the timing data of running all the s-boxes with the guess and determination algorithm. The S-boxes are generated randomly.
