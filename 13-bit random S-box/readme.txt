1.differential_goes_sbox_13_bit_v1.cpp is the program to reconstruct a 13-bit S-box by solving the sign determination problems. We compile it as random-13 with optimization flag -O2 using "g++". You can run it with the command "./random-13 a b", where a is the number of good columns you are searching for and b is the index of random S-box(sbox-13-b.txt).
2.gad_13.cpp is the program to reconstruct a 13-bit S-box with the original guess and determine algorithm. We compile it as g_d_13 with optimization flag -O2 using "g++". You can run it with the command "./g_d_13 a b", where a is the index of random S-box(sbox-13-a.txt) and b is the number of the fixed assignments. For example, we take b to be 3. We fix S(1), S(2) and S(3) to be the good options.
3.gadb_13.cpp is the program which samples 100 random bad options for S(1), S(2), S(3) and S(4) and tests the average time to search these branches. We compile it as g_d_13 with optimization flag -O2 using "g++".
4.cnt_13.cpp is to count the number of the bad options before it reaches the right assignment S(1), S(2), S(3) and S(4).
5.output-13.txt records the timing data of running all the s-boxes with our approach. gad-13.txt records the timing data of running all the s-boxes by fixing S(1), S(2), S(3) and S(4) to the right values. gadb-13.txt and cnt_13bit.txt are the results from gadb_13.cpp and cnt_13.cpp on all the s-boxes.
